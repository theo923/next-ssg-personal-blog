Today, I have created contact page and insert into this blog successfully.
Here's the layout of the page:
<br/><br/>
<Image layout='fill' src='/image/Blog/20210704-0239/20210704-0007.png'></Image>
The viewer should fill in all the blanks, then the request will be sent to the api.
The api will then connect to the MongoDB and insert the data on the Database
<br/><br/>
The client will then recognise the request 
and return 'Thanks for your comment' to let user know their action has finished.

There are something I would like to take a note while connecting between NextJS & MongoDB
<Image layout='fill' src='/image/Blog/20210704-0239/20210704-0001.png'></Image><br/>
First, check if you have install mongodb and update it to its latest version
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

Second, make sure to add <code>{useNewUrlParser: true & useUnifiedTopology: true}</code> parameter for connect function if you are using the latest update of MongoDB
<br/><br/>
This is because the current method is deprecated, therefore, if you want to use the latest version with the newest features, you should add these parameter.

Third, if you decide to add a environmental variable, you should place it into these place:<br/>
next.config.js: You should set the variable to bind with the enviornmental variable. In my case if you have enable PWA, that is fine if variable is added inside the scope.
<br/><br/>

The Cloud platform: you should add the environmental variable in it so the Cloud platform will recognise the value and return the value to the deployment.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

Make sure you have edit the Network Access in the MongoDB setting, 
otherwise the Cloud platform would not be allowed to access to the database because the connection is restricted until you have modified it.

Here's my work for today~
