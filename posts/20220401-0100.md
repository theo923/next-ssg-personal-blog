<h3>React 18 is officially released, Therefore, I have upgraded my app for the new version.</h3>
<h3>One feature that noticed me is the Suspense Method, it supports SSR in React 18, it allows me to show some prompt while loading in the basic practice. I think I will use it a lot of time in the future.</h3>
<h3>For the website, I fixed the problem for the task color.</h3>
