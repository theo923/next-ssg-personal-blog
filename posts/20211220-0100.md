<h3>By using date-fns, I can create a calendar easily.</h3>
<h3>I am surprised that how functional programming can create a calendar with a few codes</h3>
<h3>and then I just created a simple layout for it.</h3>
<h3>I also created a job board which stored different functions that I created recently.</h3>
<h3>The first one is the Create Task Board: It helps user create their task to specific date easily.</h3>
<h3>The second one is the Task Board: It shows the full content of the task like the title and the description.</h3>
<h3>I will stop here for today. wish I can spare some time to continue my works tomorrow.</h3>
