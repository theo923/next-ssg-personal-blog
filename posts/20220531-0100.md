<h3>I know Flow Typing today</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>It is quite similar with TypeScript, but there are some differences between them. Like Flow Typing is designed for ReactJS and TypeScript is designed for general JavaScript language. This allows Flow Typing having useful and interesting function which helps maintaining types on React framework.</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>That's why many projects still using Flow Typing as their type checker instead of TypeScript nowadays.</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>With the experiences of using TypeScript, it is quite handy for me to catch up on this library, and I would like to learn it further!!</h3>
