when using Apollo client & GraphQL,
sometimes the params that needed for query is received from its parent, 
however, the page is rendered and the query cannot received any props.
How do we fix it? Apollo provide us a option from the graphql method
<br/><br/>
<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>
export default graphql(fetchSong, {
    options: props => { return { variables: { id: props.param.id } } }
})(SongDetail);</code></pre>
<br/><br/>
By doing this, GraphQL will then intercept to the props object 
and allow to work with it before getting passed,
therefore query with parameters from props will then be execute automatically when rendering the following page.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

Next, Apollo client do not know the data about will it be reuse again,
the data will not be reusable while finished a render.
Then, Apollo Client have provide a way to store it as cache.
<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>
const client = new ApolloClient({
  dataFromObject: o => o.id
});
</code></pre>
It helps identify the information that its already been pulled down from the server &
 store it into inside of local cache and be ready for reuse.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>


Finally, Error Handling in GraphQL is also important.
<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>
onSubmit = e => {
	e.preventDefault()
	this.props.mutate({
		variables: {
			content: this.state.content,
			songId: this.props.songId
		}
	}).then(() => this.setState({ content: ''}))
		.catch(res => {
			const errors = res.graphQLErrors.map(error => error.message);
			this.setState({errors})
		})
}</code></pre>
If error is occured, it will be received by the catch method, and then return a object about the error.
We can use array to store the object.graphQLErrors property, this is the property that contains error message,
then, we can save it into the state and prompt the user what error is occured.

That's all, I have finished the basic course about GraphQL & Apollo Client.
It is a great tool for managing complex relation and I suggest it to all of you!!
