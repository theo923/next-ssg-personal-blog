<p class="text-4xl">Socket.io</p>
<br/>

A library for JavaScript who enables communication between browser & server with socket in a easier way.
It provides a real time connection like talking to someone with telephone.
For example, A real time chat app can post message to the server and anyone in the server will receive the message.
The message will be broadcase to all its clients and all the clients can view it through the site.
<br/><br/>
It is interesting. If I have to build a chat app in the future, I would consider importing Socket.io into my app.

<p class="text-4xl">Revise on React.memo</p>
<br/>
In normal situation, if user do not specify any control and interact with the app, 
the react components will then be rendered every move that user made.
Therefore, the speed of the app may be slowed down.
<br/><br/>
However, if we set the selected component as React.memo,
it means the component is memoized by react,
and in the next rendering, react will use the memoized result instead of rerendering it one more time ,
It can avoid the rendering for the specific component if other component is rerendering,
So the performance will be enhanced because less components is needed to rerender.<br/>
<br/>Example:<br/>
<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>
function MyComponent(props) {

}
function areEqual(prevProps, nextProps) {

}
export default React.memo(MyComponent, areEqual);
</code></pre><br/>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p class="text-4xl">Revise on React.Context</p>
<br>
In normal application, we usually pass state to children and allow the children to read the props to perform actions.
However, sometimes there are many components and layers that needed to be access when passing the props,
 thus, it would made the codes more redundant(need to mention it every layer) 
 and maintenence work become more difficult(we need to replace/add props to every layer when we are adding/deleting props).
React.Context help ease this issue, it provide a way to share the values between components without passing props to every level of layer.
