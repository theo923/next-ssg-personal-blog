One good thing to announce - I got a New Job<br/>

This time is the permanent role, it's time for me to get into a real job environment<br/>

For the first week, as I can see, my company have many experienced developer, there are much skills I can learn with.<br/>
They are nice and the job is challenging.<br/>
I enjoy working in a fast paced environment, and I feel like I am growing faster although I just entered the company for the first week.<br/>
After the working hour, I am still learning and looking to grow.<br/>
I have started a new project yestaurday, please check my next blog post!<br/>
