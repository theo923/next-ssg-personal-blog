<p>Dependency Injection</p>
<p>Object that supplies the dependencies of another object</p>
<p>In normal case, if we want to implement a database, we need to go ahead and create object of the deep class to every pages we have.</p>
<p>Then, if we want to implement another object like email, we have do it as well, thus, this is redundant and difficult if we want to make individual changes.</p>
<p>However, if we implement dependency injection, Dependency Injection Container will take care the creation of the email and pass to any remaining container if required.</p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p>.Net Core Pipeline</p>
<p>In the pipeline, we can position all of the middleware which is required for functionality.</p>
<p>you can inject middleware like Authentication, MVC and HTTPS Redirection in the pipeline.</p>
<p>They will affect how the response is eventually.</p>
<p>When one is ended, they will pass to the next middleware until the pipeline reached to the end.</p>
<p>Then, it will return the response to the server.</p>
