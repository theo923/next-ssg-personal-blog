<p>Due to the issues from the internet provider,</p>
<p>my github streak ended and I will not be able to access any files of my learning material for half month.</p>
<p>I am afraid I can not keep contribute to github every day and working on my current freelance job & personal project until the network issue is solved.</p>
<p>Therefore, I could not updated my blog until the engineer solve the issue for my home.</p>
<p>Noted that my network provider is BT.</p>
