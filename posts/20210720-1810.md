<p>Spent a day finding the next useful language & framework would benefit my project.</p>
<p>I am very interested in creating a wrapper using Python.</p>
<p>The second thing I need to concern about is the framework that I am going to use.</p>
<p>I see a lot of people in the web judging whether Django or Flask is better.</p>
<p>Although I may learn both of them, I want to a framework that easier to catch up.</p>
<p>I learnt python before, now I have spent sometimes revise what I have learnt before</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Here's for today!</p>
