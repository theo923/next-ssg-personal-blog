Spent some hours after work<br/>

I have updated the layout of my book metadata extrator<br/><br/>

I also have added a new function for my site - Tag manager<br/><br/>
I recognized that every time when you need to add a tag to several book, you may need to manually edit it<br/><br/>
When the situation comes to amazon data, it takes so many steps and work repeatedly.<br/>
Therefore, My app can help many people who have self-hosted library to add amazon metadata, edit as formatted metadata, and add tag on it at once.<br/>
It can help eliminate so many time for extracting a metadata for a book.<br/>
Please try my app, you will figure it out how easy to add a metadata in a new way.<br/>
