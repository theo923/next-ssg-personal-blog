I spent last day to learn to web scraping techniques using Python and Nodejs.<br/>

It is my first attempt for building a website with web scraper and I spent around two days to work for it.<br/><br/>

Finally, I have built the basic layout and functionality for the scraper app.<br/><br/>
The flow of my app: receive the web > extract the info using cheerio > data saved by the variables > option to get description located in the iframe > use puppeteer to simulate the browser and get it > make adjustment for the information > choose a suitable file format for the metadata > download it<br/><br/>
Link for the application: https://book-metadata-extractor.vercel.app/<br/>
currently support amazon kindle book, novel and comic.<br/>
I will keep update and create supports for more formats and websites.<br/>
please feel free to give me suggestions and feedbacks.<br/>
