<h3>worked for this issues for a few days, finally I just deployed this function to the server</h3>
<h3>I cancelled all REST Api routes, and use GraphQL and Apollo to avoid unauthorized access</h3>
<h3>So, In the end, the app will read the date from the backend by GraphQL only.</h3>
<h3>and the next thing to do is the registration and login features</h3>
