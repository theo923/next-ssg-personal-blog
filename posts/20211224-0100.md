<h3>Worked for this issue for a few days, finally I just deployed this function to the server.</h3>
<h3>I cancelled all REST Api routes, and use GraphQL and Apollo to avoid unauthorized access.</h3>
<h3>So, In the end, the app will read the date from the backend by GraphQL only and as the only entry point for CRUD.</h3>
<h3>Then, the next thing to do is the registration and login features and I will move to it.</h3>
