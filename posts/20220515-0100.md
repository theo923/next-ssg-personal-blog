<h3>Hi, I am currently challenge Leetcode. I think by setting up a board for process would accelerate my learning on data structure and algorithm.</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Therefore, I have added a new component which can help us tracking my own progress.</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>I have tried with Two Sum today and the board will be shown for every blogpost with Blind75 as tag.</h3>
<br/>
<br/>

<h2>1. Two Sum</h2>

<pre><code class="language-python">
def twoSum(nums, target):
    values = dict()

    for i, val in enumerate(nums):
        ans = target - val
        if ans in values:
            return [values[ans], i]

        values[val] = i

    return []
</code></pre>
