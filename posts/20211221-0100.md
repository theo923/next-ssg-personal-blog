<h3>Refactored the code, now we can directly set up a new board in the job board without specifying the attributes of the open/close windows and borders.</h3>
<h3>Allow user to select the individual task, however the feature to modify a task is not ready yet.</h3>
<h3>Will consider opening a heroku server for strapi backend.</h3>
<h3>It will allow visitor to set up their account and view their own task online.</h3>
