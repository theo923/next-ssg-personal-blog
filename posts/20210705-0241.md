<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>
export const getStaticProps = async ({params: { slug }}) => {
	const readMarkdownFile = fs.readFileSync(path.join('posts', slug + '.md'), "utf8").toString();
	const matterMarkdownFile = matter(readMarkdownFile);
	const httpString = marked(matterMarkdownFile.content);
	
	return {
		props: {
			httpString,
			data: matterMarkdownFile.data
		}
	}
}</code></pre>
<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>
handleSearchChange = e => {
	const { value } = e.target
	this.setState({ searchBox: value })
}
</code></pre>

<p>finally, I have apply PrismJS into my blog site.
before this, showing code in blog is tough,
it is necessary to deal with the responsive design with the image so that the code will not be unreadable or looks small.</p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p>Then, PrismJS help ease my pain in showing codes,
the codes now looks more clear, looks good and works well with responsive design.</p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p>I started to learn GraphQL & Apollo Client now.
These tools help us maintain the communication between backend and frontend in another way.
it help manage the complex objects & complex queries of the app.
So I have tried it and created a express server with GraphQL by following to the tutorial.</p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p>for a quick reminder, while importing express-graphql,
there is two way to import it:</p>
<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');</code></pre>
<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>const expressGraphQL = require('express-graphql').graphqlHTTP;</code></pre>
<p>I have spent sometimes to fix this issue this morning.</p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p>In schema file, scheme will tells graph about the type of data that working with, how all the relations play out between different data.
we should state clear that what properties each object has and show exactly how each object is related to each other.</p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p>while we are joining query in different position,
we should use different name with the same properties but in different location,
for example, companyId in user model, company in user type.
Therefore, we can edit the relation by adding resolve method into the specific GraphQLObjectType to return desire output.</p>
<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>
const UserType = new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: 'User',
    fields: () => ({
        id: {type: GraphQLString},
        firstName: {type: GraphQLString},
        age: {type: GraphQLInt},
        company: {
            type: CompanyType,
            resolve(parentValue, args) {
                return axios.get(`http://localhost:3000/companies/${parentValue.companyId}`)
                        .then(res => res.data);
            }
        }
     })
});
</code></pre>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p>Also, I have learnt how to use axios with graphQL.
axios have get, post, patch, delete methods, which performing well for different queries.</p>
<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>
deleteUser: {
	type: UserType,
	args: {
		id: {type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)},
	},
	resolve(parentValue, {id}){
		return axios.delete(`http://localhost:3000/users/${id}`)
			.then(res => res.data)
	}
},
</code></pre>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p>Then, I am now following the tutorial and building a site with apollo client, react router.
I leant how to mutate in both client & server side.<br/></p>
<h3>client:</h3>
<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>
gql`
    query SongQuery($id: ID!){
        song(id: $id) {
            id
            title
        }
    }
`;
</code></pre>
<h3>server:</h3>
<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>
{
	song(id: "1") {
		id
		title
	}
}
</code></pre>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p>It is necessary to know how refatch is used with Apollo Client because changing values with apollo will not trigger a re-render (Warm Cache problem),
therefore we have solutions to deal with different situations:<br/>
while query is on the props:</p>
<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>
onSongDelete = (id) => {
	this.props.mutate({variables: {id}})
	.then(() => this.props.data.refetch)
}
</code></pre>
<p>while query is not on the props:</p>
<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>
onSubmit = e => {
	e.preventDefault()

    this.props.mutate({
    	variables: { title: this.state.title },
    	refetchQueries: [{ query }]
    }).then(() => hashHistory.push('/'))

}
</code></pre>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p>It is also important to take a look on client mutation if multiple mutation is used.
This is because graphql library is not set up to take multiple queries.<br/>
one mutation:</p>
<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>
export default graphql(mutation)(SongCreate)
</code></pre>
multiple mutation:
<pre class="language-jsx" ><code>
export default graphql(mutation)(
    graphql(query)(SongList)
)
</code></pre>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p>Here's for today, I will finish the course tomorrow.</p>
